# Introduction
This repo contains a python script that uses pygame to capture controller inputs and visually show them. It also has a rumble option. This is not clean code, but everyone can use it as they like.

# Premise

I made this pygame project to capture yes-no question from subjects during a scientific experiment. I used a ps3 controller that I had readily available. The triangle button was 'yes', the circle button 'no'. I show a press visually, but also log the press. A rumble feature was added to remind the participant that they needed to do an action.

# Arguments
- controller-capture.py -h for help
- controller-capture.py -o <outputfile> to write logs to a specific output file
